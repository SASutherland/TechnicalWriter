# "So, enlighten me. What does a technical writer actually do?"

I was once asked this question during a job interview. Admittedly, I drew a blank.

The question was simple enough. But even though I'd worked as a technical writer for several years, somehow I'd never put it all into words. How does one distill their entire profession into just one paragraph or even _one sentence_?

While staring up at the ceiling, I rambled on about collaborating with "[**subject matter experts**](https://trainingindustry.com/glossary/subject-matter-expert-sme/)," creating how-to manuals and troubleshooting guides to improve the "[**user experience**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience)," and storing essential data with "[**content management systems**](https://searchcontentmanagement.techtarget.com/definition/content-management-system-CMS)," but I didn't offer a clear picture of what we actually do on a day-to-day basis. In short, I left the interviewer scratching his head.

I've had a lot of time to consider it since then. Occasionally, I get asked the same question by friends and family who wonder how exactly I spend my days. To someone who has never worked on a team with technical writers before, it can be hard to explain because it's such a multifaceted role. But let's give it a shot:

### We simplify.

First off, technical writers act as a liaison between the engineer and the customer, taking complicated ideas and processes and **explaining them so that anyone can understand**, regardless of expertise. The simpler, the better. We know our target audience and tailor our documents just for them. Engineers, for all their great qualities, are not always great at describing things in such a way that non-engineers can grasp (sorry!). And that's where we come in. **Think of us as translators, filtering through pages of complex information and turning those paragraphs into short, punchy sentences**.

In other words, we meet with the experts at our company, interview them, get the inside scoop on what they've been working on, and then **bring that information directly to you**, using clear documentation to illustrate exactly what we've learned. **We do this for both our customers and colleagues** because there may be other teams (or even other engineers) who need that information, too.

**Say you've made an exciting new product**. It's been in development for years and now it's finally ready to be released. It has 20 different functionalities. It's going to completely change our lives in ways that we can't possibly imagine — like the automobile or the Internet. **How would you describe this product to someone who's never used it before? How would you explain all of its functionalities to a novice? Where would you even begin?** If it's overly complicated, chances are you'll need a technical writer. 

### Never call customer service again.

Secondly, we answer your questions, so ideally **you will never need to call a customer service rep ever again**. If a technical writer has done her job well, all the information you need should be readily available. It will be clear. It will be easy to find. Anyone who's ever had an issue with their cellphone or laptop might be able to relate; most of us don't call customer service right away when something goes wrong. Instead, we first try to fix it ourselves. 

Were you able to troubleshoot your issue with a quick Google search? Did you find a brief, easy-to-understand article that guided you through, step by step, how to solve the problem? Was placing a call to customer service completely unnecessary? Well then, you probably have a technical writer to thank for that.

### We're technically savvy.

Thirdly, we're capable of using complex software. Being a good writer is a prerequisite, but we can't do our jobs solely with Microsoft Word. We need some technical know-how as well, like the ability to work with programming languages such as [**JavaScript**](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp), [**Python**](https://www.python.org/), and [**C++**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B). This is because we have to write about running scripts and filling in parameters. We also use XML editors and design tools to lay out our documents. **We want them to be engaging, compelling, and user-friendly**. We want them to be bold and bright with vivid colors, so we add images, flowcharts, and graphs to help our readers. To do so, we need a wide array of applications and software. We might even create tutorial videos using [**Camtasia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camtasia) or design our own graphics for you. Whatever is needed to make it easier to understand.

See what I mean when I said this job was multifaceted?

**There's even some data management involved**, as technical writers typically work with huge amounts of information. This data needs to be organized in a precise, orderly fashion so that it can be accessed easily — therefore, all digital content files have to be sorted and stored in the right place. To this end, we use content management systems where we can search for and archive essential documentation. On top of everything else, most technical writers are skilled data managers.

### Make it even simpler!

So, now that we've established a basic idea of what a technical writer does, how can we boil it down even further — maybe to one sentence? I like the definition offered by Judy Steiner-Williams, an author and instructor whose courses can be found on [**LinkedIn Learning**](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/). According to her, a technical writer:

> "gathers, develops, and presents technical information in a clear, concise document for a specific audience."

I think that sums it up nicely – I just wish I'd known that before my interview.
